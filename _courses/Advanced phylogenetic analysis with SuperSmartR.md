This course will introduce you to a series of R packages that together form a complete phylogenetic analysis pipeline. The tutorials outline all necessary steps for a phylogenetic inference and also demonstrates the steps for advancing and scaling up the method. In this course you will be introduced to the four existing supersmartR packages: phylotaR, restez, outsider, gaius. You will furthermore run simple exercises to create phylogenetic pipelines, develop your own customised analysis pipeline, improve your R programming skills, and become aware of the different phylogenetic and computing options. We encourage you to bring your own data and questions, and if possible run this course together in a small group â€“ this will make the exercises more fun and comprehensible.
