This module is intended as a Python introduction course, not assuming any prior knowledge of the programming language. It is however useful and desired for participants to have had prior exposure to a different programming language (such as R, bash, Perl, etc.). During this half-day module, you will cover the basic python syntax, starting with the basic objects such as strings, lists, dictionaries and arrays. You will learn how to import packages into python, enabling a variety of third-party functions, with a focus on common applications in biology (packages related to sequence data, and reading of data frames). There is potential for a follow up this tutorial with other tutorials (e.g. Advanced Python for biologists).
