    The Swedish Museum of Natural History (NRM) hosts SBDI, and is the home for key positions in 
    the Executive office, including the SBDI Director and Project Coordinator. NRM is responsible 
    for the core technical infrastructure and leads the Swedish node of the 
    <a href="https://gbif.org/">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a>, GBIF. NRM offers 
    support to data providers in mobilizing data, with particular focus on tools provided by the 
    GBIF and <a href="https://living-atlases.gbif.org/">Living Atlases communities</a>. NRM holds 
    some of the largest natural history collections in Europe, and is active in sharing 
    traditional specimen data from these and other collections in Sweden. NRM is also actively 
    involved in developing infrastructure for publishing genetic biodiversity data, and hosts 
    research projects in biodiversity and evolution facilitated by SBDI.
