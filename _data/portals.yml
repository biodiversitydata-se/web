  description: >-
    BioCollect allows researchers to set up projects with specified systematic inventory schemes and 
    coordinate the work with staff or volunteers collecting data. This could include standardized 
    instructions to data collectors, data entry, data flow, quality checks and finally data publishing.

  description: >-
    nfcore/ampliseq is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for 16S rRNA or ITS amplicon sequencing data
    (currently supported is Illumina paired end or PacBio). The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow
    tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with
    docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

  description: >-
    UC-WRAM is a portal for biotelemetry sensor data from animals. UC-WRAM hosts several million measurements from 
    sensors deployed on animals, ranging from positions (GPS), acceleration, proximity, heart rate to body 
    temperature and physiological data from internal sensors for many different species. The database is associated 
    with tools to query, filter, adn download relevant data.

  description: >-
    The SBDI Biologging Portal is a portal for exploring data through a meta-data register. It is also for 
    visualizing samples of data to better understand qualities and possible limitations of the different 
    datasets. You will find measurements from sensors deployed on animals, ranging from positions/movements, 
    activity, proximity, heart rate, body temperature and other physiological data from internal sensors for 
    many different species. The database is connected to tools to query, filter, visualize and in some cases 
    direct download of data.
