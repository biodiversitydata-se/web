Ecology research has not yet reached the big data revolution, while the forthcoming ‘data deluge’ creates many challenges for researchers in fields of biodiversity, ecology, conservation biology and systematics.

This two-day conference, January 24-25, 2024, invites the Swedish biodiversity research community to assemble and together pave the way for data-driven research in ecology. It’s for everyone who wants to make use of the big data wave that is building up within ecology research.
