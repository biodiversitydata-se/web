<p><strong>Welcome to a symposium about Insights from the <a href="https://www.insectbiomeatlas.org">Insect Biome Atlas project</a>.<br/>
</strong>When: Tuesday, 29th October, 8.30 – 14.00<br/>
Where: The Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, Small Auditorium, (lower level floor).</p>
<p>Insect diversity science is undergoing transformative changes thanks to the introduction of cheap<br/>
and effective DNA-based methods (so-called DNA metabarcoding) for species identification.<br/>
This symposium highlights the new insights into the structure of insect communities generated<br/>
by these methods and the new opportunities for biodiversity monitoring that they open up!<br/>
Our focus will be on the results generated by the Insect Biome Atlas project — funded by the<br/>
Knut &amp; Alice Wallenberg Foundation—in which the insect faunas of Sweden and Madagascar and<br/>
their associated microbiomes were analyzed in some of the most ambitious inventory projects<br/>
using these methods to date.</p>
<p>Speakers: Andreia Miraldo, Ela Iwaszkiewicz-Eggebrecht, Fredrik Ronquist, Ayco Tack/Laura van Dijk, Robert Goodsell, Tobias Andermann, Samantha López Clinton, Piotr Łukasik, Tomas Roslin.</p>
