description: Swedish Biodiversity Symposium (SBS2025 ) is a science-policy interface-oriented forum for communication, dissemination, and discussion of science-based knowledge on biodiversity. It provides an opportunity to gain new perspectives, learn from one another, and engage in networking and new collaborations.
---

With the main theme: *“Transformative change – from knowledge to action”*, the symposium invites to discussions from multiple perspectives, including conservation, genetic resources, evolution, decision-making, species loss, ecosystem services/nature’s contributions to people, nature-based solutions, restoration efforts, monitoring work, psychology, climate, land use, health, economic incentives/policy instruments, food security, pollution, and more.

**SBS2025** will showcase the outstanding expertise within Swedish biodiversity knowledge and research. It welcomes both national and international participants working with biodiversity, regardless of professional role, including those active in academia, research institutions, government agencies, businesses, and non-governmental organizations engaged in research, policymaking, nature management, education, outreach, and more.

Keynotes and plenary sessions will be held in English. The program will indicate whether other individual sessions are conducted in English or Swedish, depending on the content. A key aim is to create a program that not only attracts those already working with biodiversity but also those who have not yet discovered its importance.

Call for sessions closes on 22 January (deadline).

Joint Organization Committee: The strategic research area *BECC (Biodiversity and Ecosystem services in a Changing Climate) at Lund and Gothenburg Universities, GGBC (Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre), Bolin Centre for Climate Research (BCCR), SLU Swedish Biodiversity Centre (CBM) &amp; Artdatabanken and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)*.

In Gothenburg 21-23 October 2025.
