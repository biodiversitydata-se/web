This forward-looking conference will bring together researchers working in the fields of ecology, biology, biodiversity, remote sensing, genetic monitoring, Earth system science, and data science, to examine how AI and machine learning are reshaping the study of Life on Earth. We’ll explore the power and promise of big data methods—including **e-DNA**, **a-DNA**, **remote sensing**, and **image analysis**—when coupled with advanced AI and ML techniques. From tracking species via drones and autonomous submarines to processing massive ecological datasets in real time, the road to **full AI implementation in robotics** is already under construction.
 
Our sessions will delve into emerging technologies such as **Digital Twins** of ecosystems—virtual replicas that allow simulation and prediction of biodiversity changes—and highlight how these depend on advanced **infrastructure**, robust metadata, and open data standards. Further, we will highlight real-world breakthroughs in **biomonitoring**, **genetic monitoring**, and **AI-enhanced insights** into **extinctions through time**.
 
Equally important, SBDI Days 2026 will address the **ethics of generative AI**: How can tools capable of creating synthetic data be applied responsibly in ecology and biodiversity research? What frameworks are needed to combat **AI model-based hallucinations**, including biased data, fake data, and algorithmic bias? And how do we ensure that the rapid adoption of AI aligns with principles of fairness, accountability, and scientific transparency?
 
If we are to unlock the full potential of AI in ecology and conservation, we must do so with care, collaboration, and a shared commitment to integrity in science. The Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI) invites you to be part of this essential conversation.
Join us at **SBDI Days 2026** to connect, challenge assumptions, and help shape the ethical, technical, and ecological future of artificial intelligence in ecology and biodiversity research!
