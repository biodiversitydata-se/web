<p><strong>Welcome to the inauguration week of the Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure, a platform for publishing and accessing data on biodiversity, starting on Monday October 4. During the official launch we will introduce you to Sweden’s most important </strong><strong>e-infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research in the emerging landscape of biodiversity information systems.</strong></p>
<p>Join us online to learn more on how to make use of the largest collection of freely available biodiversity data in Sweden. Whether a researcher or practitioner, you may use the SBDI platform to efficiently submit, retrieve, visualize and analyze biodiversity data.</p>
<p>The official inauguration of Sweden’s national access hub for biodiversity data, the Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure (SBDI) happens on Monday October 4, 2021, at 10.00 to 12.00 CEST (8:00-10:00 UTC).</p>
<p>Key note speakers during the inauguration ceremony are <strong>Alexandre Antonelli</strong>, Director of Science, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and <strong>Donald Hobern</strong>, Executive Secretary, International Consortium for the Barcoding of Life (iBOL).

<p><strong>Facts</strong></p>
<p>The Swedish Biodiversity Data Infrastructure is an open-source software e-infrastructure financed by the Swedish Research Council and developed in close collaboration with the Living Atlases community and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The infrastructure will make biodiversity data available, provide powerful analysis and visualization tools, and thereby offer new opportunities for innovative and interdisciplinary research on biodiversity and ecosystems.</p>
<p>The core mission of SBDI is to support Open Science and the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles in biodiversity and ecosystems research. The SBDI consortium includes 11 universities and government agencies in Sweden.</p>
