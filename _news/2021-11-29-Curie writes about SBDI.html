<p><strong>The Swedish Research Council addresses the SBDI network in its online magazine Curie.</strong><br/>The article states that “Sweden has a long and unique tradition of collecting data on biological diversity, but so far it has been difficult to find and analyze all information. A new research infrastructure will change that.” The text is written in Swedish. The Swedish Research Council is Sweden’s largest governmental research funding body, and supports research of the highest quality within all scientific fields.</p>
