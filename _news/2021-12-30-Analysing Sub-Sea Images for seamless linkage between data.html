<p><strong>A new innovation project will make valuable subsea data and data products available to academic researchers and other societal end users.</strong></p>
<p>In November 2021 Swedish government research council for sustainable development (FORMAS) granted a new project to our SBDI partner at the University of Gothenburg. In this innovation project we will develop our system for subsea image analysis further towards a national platform including combining citizen science and machine-learning approaches. More specifically, we will develop seamless links between existing data archives, thematic eLabs for image data processing, high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure as well as the SBDI Bioatlas. Thereby we will make available valuable subsea data and data products to academic researchers and other societal end users. The project starts in late December 2021 and ends in November 2023. <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/victorav/the-koster-seafloor-observatory/about/results" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Find out more on the project website</a>. <br/>For more information, please contact Matthias Obst at the University of Gothenburg.</p>
