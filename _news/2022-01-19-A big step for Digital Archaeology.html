<p><strong>Grants from the Swedish Research Council will enable SweDigArch to construct and run the Swedish National Infrastructure for Digital Archaeology, catalysing a new generation of data driven research on human-environment interactions. </strong></p>
<p>This will facilitate the production of aggregated and harmonised datasets previously unmatched in scope, fulfilling demands for cutting-edge integrative, interdisciplinary research on long-term socio environmental dynamics. It will enable new approaches for digital methods, reinvent archaeological research agendas and ensure Swedish archaeology is part of the data science revolution. <a href="http://swedigarch.se/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">More information on SWEDIGARCH – SVEDIGARK webpage</a>.</p>
