<p><strong>Upgrades to improve computing performance during the summer and early fall.</strong></p>
<p>The SBDI team is now upgrading and moving the SBDI platform to a new OpenStack provider to make the system more robust and capable. After the move is completed, SBDI tools and services will be backed by the resources of Swedish high-performance computing centers, allowing us to increase the frequency of data updates and giving users more convenient access to the computational power needed for big-data analyses. We do not foresee any service outages at this point but users may experience temporary issues with our services during this period, and we apologize beforehand for this.</p>
