<p><strong>The SBDI team for genetic biodiversity data has published a paper on <a href="https://asv-portal.biodiversitydata.se/index">the Swedish ASV portal</a> in BMC Bioinformatics. Now you can contribute your own datasets.</strong></p>
<p>The portal is an interface to SBDI records of DNA barcode sequences (Amplicon Sequence Variants; ASVs) and associated species occurrences that derive from high throughput sequencing of environmental (eDNA) samples (metabarcoding). More specifically, it functions as a semi-integrated module of the SBDI Bioatlas, and primarily allows users to search for ASVs and Bioatlas records using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), or via filters on taxonomy and sequencing details. The portal also enables users to submit their own data, and SBDI warmly welcomes data contributions from the metabarcoding community.</p>
