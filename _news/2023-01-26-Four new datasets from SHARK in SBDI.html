<p><strong>During 2022 and the start of 2023, SMHI has published four new datasets from the SHARK database.</strong></p>
<p>It concerns time series from national and regional monitoring programs for vegetated bottoms (Epibenthos), as well as time series from national programs for ringed seal (<em>Pusa hispida</em>) and picoplankton. Previously published time series have all been updated with new data in 2022. All datasets are sampling event data and contain a lot of information in addition to species observations.</p>
