<p><strong>On Samernas nationaldag (The Sami National Day), we want to draw attention to two datasets that SBDI mobilizes and that come from the Sami community.</strong></p>
<p>These data sets are:<br/>• <a href="https://collections.biodiversitydata.se/public/show/in4">Ájtte</a> (“nature of the mountains”-collection, including: insects, birds, mammals, fish, fungi, minerals, rocks and botanicals.<br/>• <a href="https://collections.biodiversitydata.se/public/show/in10">Forests and Sami Museum</a> (specimens and observations of the beetle collection)</p>
<p>We would also like to mention in this context that SBDI works towards <a href="https://www.gida-global.org/care">the CARE principles</a>.</p>
<p>The Sami National Day is common to all Sami regardless of whether they live in Sweden, Norway, Finland or Russia. It is a day that is usually celebrated with activities and cultural events.</p>
