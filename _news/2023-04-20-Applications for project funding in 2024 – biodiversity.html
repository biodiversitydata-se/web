<p>The Nordic Working Group for Biodiversity (NBM) funds Nordic collaborative projects aimed at stemming the loss of biodiversity. In 2024, NBM will prioritise applications from projects working towards the new biodiversity targets, as well as projects dealing with nature and wildlife crime, the sustainable use of existing buildings, forestry and consideration of cultural environments/nature. Applications that fall within the scope of NBM’s remit but outside of these priorities may also be considered. </p>
<p>Applications should be submitted<a href="mailto:NBM@us.fo"> </a>by Friday, 9 June 2023.</p>
