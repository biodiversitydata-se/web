<p><strong>The w<strong>ork on a new portal for Swedish Research Data has begun. This portal is one of the major goals in the Swedish National Data Service’s (SND) mission 2023–26. SBDI and GBIF Sweden are important collaboration partners and data sources for the project.</strong></strong> </p>
<p>The portal will make it easier for current and future researchers to find, share and reuse data. Thanks to harvesting from a number of collaboration partners, the researchdata.se-portal should provide a richer search result than SND’s current catalogue. A number of organizations are already engaged to provide data. Additional partners will be added both during the course of the project and after the launch of the portal, which is currently planned for the beginning of 2025.</p>
