<p><strong>The SBDI consortium welcomes everyone within the scientific community who wants to develop and ride the wave of data-driven research. </strong></p>
<p>Ecology research has not yet reached the big data revolution, while the forthcoming ‘data deluge’ creates many challenges for researchers in fields of biodiversity, ecology, conservation biology and systematics.</p>
<p>This two-day conference invites the Swedish biodiversity research community to assemble and together pave the way for data-driven research in ecology. It’s for everyone who wants to make use of the big data wave that is building up within ecology research.</p>
