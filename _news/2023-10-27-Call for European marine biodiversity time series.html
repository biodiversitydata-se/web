<p><strong>Researchers within the MARCO-BOLO-project seeking collaboration and long-term biodiversity data in order to understanding and analysing multidecadal trends of coastal and marine biodiversity at the European scale.</strong></p>
<p>In a new collaborative study, they aim to (a) compile comprehensive marine biodiversity time series in Europe to (b) disentangle the major patterns and drivers of long-term biodiversity trends using various taxonomic and functional diversity metrics, species traits, and environmental variables.</p>
<p>Within the Horizon Europe project <a href="https://marcobolo-project.eu">MARCO-BOLO</a> the researchers are currently working towards understanding and analysing multidecadal trends of coastal and marine biodiversity at the European scale. To achieve this, we have already compiled more than 1,000 time series from public resources (e.g. EurOBIS/EMODnet Biology, BioTIME, etc.). However, we believe there are many more dataseries out there that would make our study even more comprehensive. Therefore, we are reaching out to organizations and individuals who may have valuable time series that can contribute to our research.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating please contact the researchers to discuss any suggestions and collaboration terms. Data is greeted before 31 January 2024.</p>
