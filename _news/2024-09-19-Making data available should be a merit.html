<p><strong>More innovative interdisciplinary research is desired by one of SBDI’s users who believes that open data drives research forward.</strong><br/>In an <a href="https://www.tidningencurie.se/nyheter/att-gora-data-tillgangliga-borde-vara-en-merit?utm_source=Ungapped&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20240919">article in the journal Curie</a>, we meet in an interview Philip Buckland from Umeå University. Over the years, he has been involved in the development of SBDI. Philip is an environmental archaeologist and wants to make more people understand the importance of having a really long historical perspective in insect research, which otherwise usually focuses on the present.<br/>In the interview, he speaks warmly about the importance of good attribution to databases. It is important that those who make data available receive the appreciation they deserve, and that the right researchers receive recognition. Then we will get even more researchers to choose to share their data.</p>
