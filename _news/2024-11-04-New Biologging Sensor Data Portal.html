<p><strong>A new SBDI tool to find, explore and access Swedish Biologging data is now available.</strong></p>
<p>Biologging is the use of devices to track animals and collect detailed information on their movement patterns, behaviour, physiology, and interactions with their environment over time. Through the Swedish Biologging Portal you can find sensor data from animals, including movement trajectories and data characterising behaviour or physiology of animals. This is the first version of the portal making available a first sample of datasets. More datasets will become available continuously.</p>
<p>âˆ’ With the launch of the Swedish Biologging Portal, researchers now have unprecedented access to Swedish biologging data, making it easier than ever to get an overview of animal movement and behaviour. This is just the beginning, and with new datasets continually being added, only the sky is the limit, says Debora Arlt, project coordinator for the Swedish Biologging Portal.</p>
<p>The portal provides an overview of available datasets and tools to visualise the data. Our Biologging Open API provides access to the data.</p>
<p>The Swedish Biologging Portal has been developed in collaboration between Lund University (CAnMove Centre of Animal Movement) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (WRAM Wireless Remote Animal Monitoring).</p>
