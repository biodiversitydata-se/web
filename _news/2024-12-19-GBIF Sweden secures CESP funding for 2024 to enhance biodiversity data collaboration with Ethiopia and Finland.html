<p><strong><a href="https://www.gbif.se/">GBIF Sweden</a> has been awarded funding through the 2024 Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP) for the project titled <em>“Building capacity within biodiversity data between Ethiopia and GBIF nodes in Sweden and Finland.”</em></strong></p>
<p>This collaborative initiative, led by GBIF Sweden, brings together partners including <a href="https://www.aau.edu.et/">Addis Ababa University</a>, the <a href="http://www.ebi.gov.et/">Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute</a>, the <a href="https://hoarec.org/">Horn of Africa Regional Environment Centre and Network</a>, GBIF Finland, and Stockholm University. The project aims to enhance biodiversity data management and sharing between Ethiopia, Sweden, and Finland, fostering international cooperation and capacity building within the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF network</a>.</p>
<p>CESP is an annual programme that addresses specific capacity needs identified by GBIF Participants, facilitating collaboration at regional and global levels. In the 2024 round, GBIF has awarded more than €78,000 to fund four projects involving partners across 18 countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe. These projects cover a diverse range of topics, including utilizing artificial intelligence for digitizing analog data, implementing interoperable database standards, integrating traditional knowledge into biodiversity data management, and streamlining digitization workflows.</p>
<p>GBIF Sweden look forward to the successful implementation of this project and the positive impact it will have on biodiversity data management and collaboration between Ethiopia, Sweden, and Finland.</p>
