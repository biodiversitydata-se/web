<p><em>Today, 25 March, marks the launch of </em><a href="https://researchdata.se/en"><em>Researchdata.se</em></a><em>, a new national web portal designed to make it easier for researchers to find, share, and reuse research data across various disciplines.</em></p>
<p>Through a searchable platform, users gain access to thousands of datasets and resources for sustainable data management throughout the research process. The portal facilitates collaboration between universities, research infrastructures, and research organizations working with Open Science by providing a shared platform for data sharing and expert support. This strengthens interdisciplinary cooperation and enables more efficient management of research data.</p>
<p>“<em>Making research data more accessible and reusable is essential for advancing science and tackling global challenges. Through Researchdata.se, we strengthen the infrastructure for open science in Sweden and ensure that biodiversity data, along with other research data, can be used to generate new knowledge and insights</em>.” — <strong>Veronika A. Johansson, Node Manager, GBIF Sweden</strong></p>
<p><strong>GBIF Sweden and SBDI</strong> is part of Researchdata.se, an initiative launched by Swedish National Data Service (SND) as part of the effort to realise the EU’s and the Swedish government’s goal of open access to publicly funded research data. In collaboration with research infrastructures such as the <strong>Bolin Centre for Climate Research</strong>, <strong>Huminfra</strong>, <strong>InfraVis</strong>, <strong>NBIS</strong>, <strong>SciLifeLab</strong>, <strong>SITES</strong>, and <strong>Swedigarch</strong>, we contribute expertise and tools to support the research community in managing and sharing research data.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Interested in collaborating?</h3>
<p>Researchdata.se will continue to evolve, with new features added to meet future needs. Would you like to contribute? Researchdata.se welcomes new partners, including research infrastructures and repositories, which are interested in sharing research data resources, training materials, and data management tools.</p>
