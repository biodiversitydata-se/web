# {{ page.title }}

The overall vision of SBDI is to provide a cost-effective, cutting-edge infrastructure that supports Swedish and international biodiversity and ecosystems research. We want to provide Swedish researchers with unified and open access to biodiversity data, and to a wide range of tools for querying, visualizing and analyzing this data.

SBDI supports open data and [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), that is, transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks. Specifically, we adhere to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).
