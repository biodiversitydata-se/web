## R
SBDI provides [*sbdi4r2*](https://github.com/biodiversitydata-se/sbdi4r2/), an R package to search and download data from the SBDI data portal. *sbdi4r2* provides the functions to find, access, combine and visualise data on Swedish plants and animals through queries in any of the datasets provided by SBDI.

Sbdi4r2 is built on the Atlas of Living Australia platform wrapping the [*galah* package](https://galah.ala.org.au/R/) which provides similar services for the ALA.

## Python
To access SBDI data using Python code there is a [Python version of the *galah* package](https://galah.ala.org.au/Python/).

## API:s
SBDI also offers a rich set of [API:s](https://api.biodiversitydata.se) that allow you to access SBDI data and services from any programming language, so that you can develop your own tools for searching, downloading and analyzing SBDI data.
